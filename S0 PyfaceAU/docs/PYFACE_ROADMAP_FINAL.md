## The Game Plan: 3 Innings to Victory ⚾

### Inning 1: CalcParams Optimization (80ms → 30ms)
**ROI:** 50ms saved = 23% faster overall
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Plays to Run:**

**Play 1A: Replace with OpenCV solvePnP** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```python
# Current: Pure Python Gauss-Newton (80ms)
params_global, params_local = self.calc_params.calc_params(landmarks_68)

# Proposed: OpenCV solvePnP (5-10ms)
success, rvec, tvec = cv2.solvePnP(
    objectPoints=self.pdm_3d_points,  # 3D model points
    imagePoints=landmarks_68,         # 2D detected points
    cameraMatrix=self.camera_matrix,  # Pre-computed
    distCoeffs=None,
    flags=cv2.SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE
)
```

**Why it works:**
- OpenCV's solvePnP is optimized C++ (FAST)
- Does same job: 2D→3D pose estimation
- Already available, no new dependencies

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Extract 3D reference points from PDM mean shape
2. Create camera intrinsics matrix (focal length from image size)
3. Replace calc_params() call with solvePnP
4. Convert rotation vector to Euler angles
5. Test accuracy: correlation with original outputs

**Expected Result:** 217ms → 167ms (6.0 FPS)

---

**Play 1B: Numba JIT (if solvePnP doesn't work)**
```python
from numba import jit

@jit(nopython=True)
def gauss_newton_optimized(landmarks, pdm_mean, pdm_components):
    # Compile to machine code
    ...
```

**Expected Result:** 80ms → 40ms (50% speedup on CalcParams)

---

### Inning 2: PyFHOG Optimization (50ms → 25ms)
**ROI:** 25ms saved = 12% faster overall
**Difficulty:** Easy-Medium
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Play 2A: Increase cell_size (8 → 12)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```python
# Current: cell_size=8 → many cells → slow
hog_features = pyfhog.extract_fhog_features(aligned_face, cell_size=8)

# Proposed: cell_size=12 → fewer cells → faster
hog_features = pyfhog.extract_fhog_features(aligned_face, cell_size=12)
```

**Math:**
- 112x112 face @ cell_size=8 → 14x14 = 196 cells
- 112x112 face @ cell_size=12 → 9x9 = 81 cells
- **2.4x fewer cells = ~2x faster HOG**

**Risk:** May reduce AU accuracy (MUST TEST!)

**Testing Required:**
- Run 100 frames with cell_size=12
- Compare AU outputs vs baseline (must be >95% correlated)
- If accuracy drops, try cell_size=10 as compromise

**Expected Result:** 167ms → 142ms (7.0 FPS)

---

**Play 2B: Reduce aligned face size (112 → 96)**
```python
# Current: 112x112 alignment
self.face_aligner = OpenFace22FaceAligner(output_size=(112, 112))

# Proposed: 96x96 alignment
self.face_aligner = OpenFace22FaceAligner(output_size=(96, 96))
```

**Savings:** Smaller image = faster HOG (15-20% speedup)
**Risk:** Lower resolution may hurt AU accuracy

---

### Inning 3: SVR Batch Predictions (30ms → 15ms)
**ROI:** 15ms saved = 7% faster overall
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Priority:** 🟢 MEDIUM

**Play 3A: Vectorize All SVR Predictions** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```python
# Current: 17 sequential predictions (30ms)
for au_name, model in self.au_models.items():
    centered = full_vector - model['means'].flatten() - running_median
    pred = np.dot(centered, model['support_vectors']) + model['bias']

# Proposed: Single batched operation (15ms)
# Pre-processing: Stack all model parameters
all_means = np.vstack([m['means'].flatten() for m in models])
all_svs = np.hstack([m['support_vectors'] for m in models])
all_biases = np.array([m['bias'] for m in models])

# Single matrix multiply for all 17 AUs
centered = full_vector - all_means - running_median
predictions = (centered @ all_svs) + all_biases  # All 17 AUs at once!
```

**Expected Result:** 142ms → 127ms (7.9 FPS)

---

## The Championship Series: Combine All Three 🏆

**If we hit all three optimizations:**

| Optimization | Time Saved | FPS After |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Starting Point | - | 4.6 FPS |
| + CalcParams solvePnP | 50ms | 6.0 FPS |
| + PyFHOG cell_size=12 | 25ms | 7.0 FPS |
| + SVR batching | 15ms | 7.9 FPS |
| **TOTAL** | **90ms** | **~8 FPS** ✅ |

**Final Target:** 127ms/frame = **7.9 FPS**

**Success Criteria:**
- 🎯 2x faster than current (4.6 → 8+ FPS)
